Flash Cards

GA Minimal Requirements:

-------------------------------------
Pre-load your app with some data, and let the user flip through them quickly (back or front), and use the keyboard flip the card, and to mark whether they got it right or not. Track which cards were incorrect, and re-display them until the user gets them right!
-------------------------------------

MVP - Each card has a letter.  There are 6 pairs of cards.  There are two divs stacked.  The bottom div displays a letter covered up by the top div  When clicked, the color of top layer div changes becomes transparent.
